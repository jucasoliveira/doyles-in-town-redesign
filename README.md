# The Stack

## Design


## Front-end 

### Fresh : https://fresh.deno.dev/

Fresh is a full stack modern web framework for JavaScript and TypeScript developers, designed to make it trivial to create high-quality, performant, and personalized web applications. You can use it to create your home page, a blog, a large web application like GitHub or Twitter, or anything else you can think of.

####Â Getting Started
In this chapter of the Fresh documentation, you'll be introduced to the framework. You'll learn how to create a new project, run it locally, edit and create pages, fetch data, handle user interactions, and how to then deploy the project to Deno Deploy.

The documentation assumes you have Deno 1.25.0 or later installed.

To install Deno, follow the installation instructions in the Deno manual.

For the best user experience, you should also set up your editor or IDE to play nice with Deno. Documentation for this can also be found in the manual.

# Fresh project

### Usage

```
